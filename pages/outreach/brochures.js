                Everyone contributes to the generation of waste that, as a
                society, we must find responsible means to handle. For much of
                recent history, waste has been seen as having an endpoint as it
                is primarily taken away and buried in landfills. Recent
                recycling efforts locally and nationwide have managed to divert
                only - a surprisingly small percentage of materials from this
                dead end destination. Recognizing that the waste Stream is full
                of valuable materials that have an economic value, a closed loop
                system facilitating recovery, reuse, and re-manufacture of most
                of our waste is possible. For this to become a reality, there
                must be alignment of public desire, government will, and
                economic feasibility.
