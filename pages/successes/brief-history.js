                this. Though Metro's Dept. of Public Works successfully watered
                it down the scope of work, it did retain what was called "triple
                bottom line" economic valuation of recycling, which was what RAM
                had preached about for so long (see items 19-21 above) that it
                would have been just too obvious if it had been omitted.

                results so far support RAM's assessment, so RAM's integrity and
                reputation remain.
